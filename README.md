# Loan Process Optimization Analysis

##  Project Overview
Analysis of loan application processing times with recommendations for Deutsche Bank's Technology, Data & Innovation internship application.

##  Business Problem
22% of loan applications were taking over 15 days to process, impacting customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

##  Key Findings
- **1,000** loan applications analyzed
- **10.8 days** average processing time  
- **219 applications (22%)** took >15 days
- Bottleneck identified in **internal risk assessment processes**

##  Proposed Solutions
1. **Tiered Processing System** - Fast-track applications based on credit score
2. **Parallel Processing** - Run document verification and credit checks simultaneously
3. **Process Automation** - Reduce manual review times

##  Expected Impact
- **35% faster** processing (10.8 → 7.0 days)
- **70% reduction** in slow applications
- Improved customer experience

## Technical Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Analysis & Visualization
- Process Optimization
